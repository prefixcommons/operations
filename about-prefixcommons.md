PrefixCommons is a cross cutting effort started by members of the Monarch Initiative and BD2K

It integrates available information about various web identifier schemes in the life-sciences, with the aim of making this information machine actionable and human searchable by anyone for any reason.

Other great platforms exist for resolution and registration of prefixes. We are aiming to harmonize, not compete with them.

The mission of PrefixCommons is thus *not* to dictate to any community what a prefix should or should not be; that is the responsibility of the primary registries relevant in those contexts. We are just coalescing and surfacing what the circulating prefixes and URIs are that are already in use -- are in all of their ugliness with regard to both collisions (many authorities to one prefix) and scatter (many prefixes for one authority).

A very light weight demonstrator of the integrated prefix metadata corpus is here: http://prefixcommons.org More information and code to follow.
