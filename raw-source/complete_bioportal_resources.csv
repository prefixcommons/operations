The microscopy product refers to a set of related 2D images taken by light (epifluorescence, transmitted light, confocal or multiphoton) or electron microscopy (conventional or high voltage transmission electron microscopy). These image sets may comprise a tilt series, optical section series, through focus series, serial sections, mosaics, time series or a set of survey sections taken in a single microscopy session that are not related in any systematic way. A given set of data may be more than one product, for example, it is possible for a set of images to be both a mosaic and a tilt series.

Each project receives a unique Project ID that groups together related microscopy products.
